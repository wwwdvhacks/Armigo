Extend the existing Firebase-connected web app (which already uses Firebase Auth and Realtime Database-compatible chat) by adding a full trip planning module with an interactive map of Armenia, integrated into the same Firebase project.

🌍 MAP & REGION INTERFACE:
Load an interactive map of Armenia using Leaflet.js or MapLibre

Represent marzes (regions) of Armenia as visual areas or images overlaid on the map

When a marz is clicked, show a list or dots of cities in that region

Clicking a city adds it to the current trip draft

Each city must be stored by its name (e.g. "Vanadzor", "Gyumri")

🧳 TRIP PLANNING FUNCTIONALITY:
Allow user to create a trip with:

Trip name

List of selected cities (in order)

Optional description or tags

Show selected cities on the map as markers or icons

Save the trip under:

bash
Копировать
Редактировать
/trips/{uid}/{tripId}
or

bash
Копировать
Редактировать
/trips/{tripId} with "ownerId": uid
Each trip should include:

json
Копировать
Редактировать
{
  "tripId": "...",
  "ownerId": "uid123",
  "title": "My Trip to North Armenia",
  "cities": ["Vanadzor", "Spitak", "Stepanavan"],
  "status": "draft" | "finalized",
  "createdAt": timestamp
}
🧠 OPTIONAL: AI TRIP OPTIMIZATION
Button: “Optimize Trip” → runs a mock AI function (or Firebase Function) that suggests a better order of cities

Allows user to accept or ignore suggestion

🗺️ ROUTE FINALIZATION:
Button: “Finalize Route”

Shows a connected path between cities on the map

Sets trip status to "finalized"

📲 UI PAGES TO ADD:
Page	Features
/create-trip	Input for name, region selection, city selection via map
/trip/:tripId	Displays trip info, cities, map, route line, optimization button
/my-trips	Lists all trips by logged-in user

📍 MAP INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS:
Use Leaflet or MapLibre (free and works on Replit)

Optional: use a static image of Armenia overlaid as a custom layer

Cities can be placed as predefined coordinates or SVG points

Allow click-to-add and drag-to-reorder cities

💾 DATA SAVING RULES (MUST BE COMPATIBLE WITH ANDROID APP):
Trips must be saved to the same Firebase project

All city data must match Android app naming convention

Trips must be readable by Android app as-is (no extra nesting)

🔘 BUTTON LOGIC:
“Create New Trip” → initializes empty trip object

“Click Marz” → loads cities for that region

“Click City” → adds city to trip draft

“Save Trip” → saves trip object to Firebase

“Optimize Trip” → reorders cities via function

“Finalize Route” → shows route on map and updates status

🔧 Project must include:
TripCreate.jsx, TripView.jsx, TripList.jsx

Map.jsx component with interactivity

Hook or service to handle all /trips/ Firebase logic

Integration into the main app with React Router

TailwindCSS or similar for styling
